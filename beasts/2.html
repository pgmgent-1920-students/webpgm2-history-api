Baal is one of the kings of Hell in 17th-century goetic occult writings. According to some authors, Baal is a Duke with sixty-six legions of demons under his command. He is said to appear in the forms of a man, cat, toad, or combinations thereof, and has a raspy voice when he speaks. The illustration in <i>Dictionnaire Infernal</i> placed the heads of the three creatures onto a set of spider legs.
