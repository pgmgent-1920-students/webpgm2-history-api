<h2>Behemoth</h2>
<figcaption>
Behemoth is a beast mentioned in The Book of Job. Since the 17th century, there have been many attempts to identify Behemoth. Some scholars have seen him as a real creature, usually the hippopotamus, occasionally the elephant, rhinoceros, or water buffalo. Metaphorically, the name has come to be used for any extremely large or powerful entity.
